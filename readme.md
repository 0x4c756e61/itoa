# ITOA

## Image TO Ascii

### Description

A rather simple tool to convert your favourite images to **ascii**

## Discord color support

Providing the `--discord` flag itoa will convert any pixel color to the closest discord one
Results will be printed in the terminal (unless you use the `--quiet` flag)
To see the results in discord, just upload the file ending in `.ansi`
<br>
It has some issues tho:
 - Discord only provides 8 colors (so expect some weird results)
 - Can only be sent as files (Due to the 2k characters limit)
 - May freeze your discord client
